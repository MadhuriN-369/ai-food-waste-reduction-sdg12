# AI-Based Food Waste Reduction System (SDG 12)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be used to reduce food waste by predicting consumption patterns and supporting sustainable decision-making.

Aligned with **UN SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.

## Problem Statement
Food waste occurs due to poor demand forecasting and lack of data-driven planning. This leads to economic loss and increased environmental impact.

## Solution
An AI-based system that:
- Analyzes historical food consumption data
- Predicts future demand using machine learning
- Provides recommendations to reduce over-purchasing and waste
